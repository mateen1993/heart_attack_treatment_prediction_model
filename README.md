Heart disease is still one of the main causes of illness and death around the world.  

To improve patient care, it’s important to understand what causes heart disease and how treatments can help reduce its effects.  

This project will study data about heart attack patients, looking at factors like age, lifestyle, and medical history to find useful insights for making better treatment decisions.  

We’ll use machine learning to predict treatment outcomes and identify the most important factors affecting those decisions.  

The dataset includes 1,037 records, each representing a patient who has had a heart attack.
