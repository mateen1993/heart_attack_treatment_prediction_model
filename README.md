Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This project aims to utilize machine learning to predict heart attack treatment outcomes. By exploring a dataset of 1,037 patients, we investigate relationships between demographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables and their impact on treatment decisions. This research employs statistical analysis and a Random Forest model to uncover critical insights and improve predictive accuracy for patient care. The findings demonstrate both the potential and limitations of machine learning in healthcare decision-making.
