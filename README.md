Heart disease is still one of the main causes of illness and death around the world.  

To improve patient care, it’s important to understand what causes heart disease and how treatments can help reduce its effects.  

This project will study data about heart attack patients, looking at factors like age, lifestyle, and medical history to find useful insights for making better treatment decisions.  

We’ll use machine learning to predict treatment outcomes and identify the most important factors affecting those decisions.  

The dataset includes 1,037 records, each representing a patient who has had a heart attack.

• Numerical Features:
– Age: The patient’s age in years.
– Blood Pressure (mmHg): The patient’s blood pressure measured in millimetres
of mercury.
– Cholesterol (mg/dL): The patient’s cholesterol level measured in milligrams
per decilitre.

• Categorical Features:
– Gender: The patient’s gender (Male or Female).
– Smoking Status: The patient’s smoking status (Never, Former, or Current).
– Has Diabetes: Indicates whether the patient has been diagnosed with diabetes
(Yes or No).
– Chest Pain Type: The type of chest pain experienced by the patient (Typical
Angina, Atypical Angina, Non-anginal Pain, or Asymptomatic).
– Treatment: The treatment received by the patient, which could be Lifestyle
Changes, Angioplasty, Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG), or Medication.

These variables were analyzed for distribution, correlation, and predictive capability using
exploratory data analysis and machine learning.
